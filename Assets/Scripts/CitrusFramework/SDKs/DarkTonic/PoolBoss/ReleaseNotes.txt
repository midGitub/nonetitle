POOL BOSS PLUGIN - By Dark Tonic, Inc. (c) 2014

-Code by Brian Hunsaker

-V 1.0.4 - Updated Playmaker custom actions. There was a compile error.

-V 1.0.3 - Add ability to spawn by name instead of passing in a Transform. This should prove useful when I get the Bolt Network compatibility working!
		 - Added drag area to create multiple items at once by dragging them into the box when locking the Inspector.
		 - Updated UI to look better. Matched with our other plugins' new UI colors and grouped boxes.

-V 1.0.2 - Fixed warnings in the Console that occur if you spawn and despawn elements with the new uGUI components.

-V 1.0.1 - All example files and Pool Boss prefab were broken. Meta files weren't set up in the project. Now fixed!

-V 1.0 - Submitted 10/21/2014 on the Asset Store
